# MoogFilter
Moog ladder filter implementation writtern in Python, used in [pitcher.py](https://github.com/mwcm/pitcher) to approximate the SP-1200's SSM2044

requires numpy


Based on the [Improved Model](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders/blob/master/src/ImprovedModel.h) from [ddiakopoulos](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos)'s [MoogLadders](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders) repo. The Improved Model itself is based on D'Angelo & Valimaki's ["An Improved Virtual Analog Model of the Moog Ladder Filter"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders/master/research/DAngeloValimaki.pdf)
